# Modeling software

From school we have [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview) for free. So it makes sense to use, additionaly we can combine it with [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?us_oa=dotcom-us&us_si=0544e627-eb50-497a-8a84-004e25640650&us_st=EAGLE&term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=FSN), which should be also for free, to create 3D models of PCBs.

I didn't work with Fusion 360 so I can't help with that.

Other options for 3D modeling are:
- [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) - From Autodesk (web based and very easy)
- [OnShape](https://www.onshape.com/en/) - Web based free software

If you know other options you can share it here.
