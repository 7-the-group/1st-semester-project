# Arduino thungs to learn

As we are learning C on embedded systems we will use it in our project as well. Arduino is usually programmed with C++, which is basically the same but has some more things.

You can learn C [here](https://www.w3schools.com/c/).

When working with Arduino it is very important to get familiar with this [document](../../datasheets/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf), where you can find everything about chip on Arduino nano. If you think it is very long and not clear, then you will be delighted to hear that this is the simplest and best structured datasheet I had ever work with. You do not have read it all basic orientation in it.

Here is [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EXXqWweTkI) about how to read datasheets.

You always learn by doing things, therefore there are some websites with Arduino projects or simulations.

[Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/arduino) - Website for simulating circuits with Arduino and Arduino itself.

[Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard) - This website can do much more than 3D modeling.

[Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Projects/) - Website with projects for Arduino.

[Arduino projects](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/) - Official Arduino website with projects.
