# PCB design

For PCB design we can use [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/), [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) or [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/).

KiCAD - I used KiCAD the most and I prefer it over Eagle also it is more beginner friendly, but now we have everything from autodesk for free I would try Eagle. KiCAD has built in 3D visualizer of PCB.

Eagle - We can use it in combination with [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/fusion).

EasyEDA - This application is web based (but can be downloaded as an application). It is designed to be as easy as possible and you can directly order PCBs from [JLC-PCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) in EasyEDA

## Youtube channels and learning resources

[Phil's lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab) - He is mostly using KiCAD and Altium designer.

We are not going to do very complicated circuits, so basic understanding of PCB design and orientation PCB design software should be enough.
