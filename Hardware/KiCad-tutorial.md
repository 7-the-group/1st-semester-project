When working with KiCad, three files are important:

- **.kicad_pro** = file with this sufix is a project file, when you open it, project view will show up with schematic and board. This file is important to connect schematic and board so baord can be updated in accordance to schematic.
- **.kicad_sch** = file with schematic.
- **.kicad_pcb** = file with board (PCB).

Usually you can use parts available in kicad but sometimes you need to import schematic symbols and footprints from other places like snapeda [here](https://youtu.be/W9cLnIjvybo) is a tutorial on how to do it.
