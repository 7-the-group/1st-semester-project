## Changes in PCB
We settled down on using two potentiometers in room 3 and we connect buttons in room 2 in parallel so they occupy only one pin. Last pin can be used for button for sleep or other functionality.

## 3D model of the house
We diced to route cables in a hollow floor. Overall design has one corridor in the middle and two rooms on the sides. Corridor is the room 2 at the same time.
