# Group 7 semester project

# How to start

All the necessary parts are in Product folder. In Product/PCB there are two zip files for PCB manufacturing one is for PCB with the Arduino and the other one is for PCB with buttons. When PCBs are printed and assembled refer to the documentation appendices for correct connection.

In Product/Models folder you can find .stl files for control panel casing and base. We also created casings for potentiometers and buttons however those serve only esthetic function. Next there is .dxf file, which contains walls model for laser cutter.

Finally in Product/Software folder is PlatformIO project with all the necessary code, just upload it to Arduino.
